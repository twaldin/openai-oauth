# openai-oauth

[Fork](https://github.com/twaldin/openai-oauth) | [Upstream](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/openai-oauth) | [Legal](#legal)

OpenAI-compatible local endpoint backed by your ChatGPT account.

## Usage

The command below runs the published npm package, not this fork's checkout. To run the fork from source, follow the [repository instructions](../../README.md#this-fork).

```bash
npx openai-oauth
```

When startup succeeds, the CLI prints:

```text
OpenAI-compatible endpoint ready at http://127.0.0.1:10531/v1
Use this as your OpenAI base URL. No API key is required.
Available Models: gpt-5.4, gpt-5.3-codex, ...
```

If no auth file is available, it fails early and tells you to run:

```bash
npx @openai/codex login
```

## Features

What currently works:

- Working Endpoints:
  - `/v1/responses`
  - `/v1/chat/completions`
  - `/v1/models` (account-aware by default, or overridden with `--models`)
- Streaming Responses
- Toolcalls
- Reasoning Traces

## Reasoning Defaults

From this repository's root, set defaults for the fork's CLI:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/openai-oauth dev --reasoning-effort high --reasoning-summary auto
```

- `/v1/chat/completions`: request `reasoning_effort` takes precedence over `--reasoning-effort`, for both streaming and non-streaming calls. Summary mode comes from `--reasoning-summary`; this route does not read a request-level summary setting.
- `/v1/responses`: normalization adds a default `reasoning` object only when the request omits that object. An existing object, including `{ "effort": "low" }` or `{}`, is preserved as a whole; missing fields are not filled. Separately, a missing top-level `reasoning_effort` receives the configured effort.

These settings control the outgoing request; model support still determines which effort and summary values are usable.

## Known Limitations

What is intentionally not there yet:

- Only LLMs supported by Codex are available. This lists updates over time and is dependent on your Codex plan.
- Login flow is intentionally not bundled. Simply run `npx @openai/codex login` to create the auth file.
- There is no stateful replay support on the CLI `/v1/responses` endpoint. The proxy is stateless and expects callers to send the full conversation history.

## How it Works

OpenAI's Codex CLI uses a special endpoint at `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` to let you use special OpenAI rate limits tied to your ChatGPT account.

By using the same Oauth tokens as Codex, we can effectively use OpenAI's API through Oauth instead of buying API credits.
