# openai-oauth

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai-oauth) | [Upstream](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/openai-oauth) | [Legal](#legal)

Free OpenAI API access with your ChatGPT account.

The published CLI runs with `npx openai-oauth`. To run this fork, use the checkout instructions below.

## This Fork

This is [twaldin/openai-oauth](https://github.com/twaldin/openai-oauth), a fork of EvanZhouDev/openai-oauth. Its local feature commit, [`b471a45`](https://github.com/twaldin/openai-oauth/commit/b471a45632fd93ca8cb650379cfbe2f728a5e101), adds configurable reasoning defaults. The package names and upstream notices are retained; `npx openai-oauth` resolves the npm package, not this checkout.

From this repository's root, install the locked dependencies with Bun and run the CLI from source:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run --cwd packages/openai-oauth dev --help
bun run --cwd packages/openai-oauth dev --reasoning-effort high --reasoning-summary auto
```

The last command requires an existing local auth file and starts the proxy. The package READMEs describe the [CLI](packages/openai-oauth/README.md) and [provider](packages/openai-oauth-provider/README.md) settings in this checkout.

## How to Use

You can currently use `openai-oauth` in two different ways:

### `openai-oauth` CLI

This package lets you create a localhost proxy to `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` pre-authenticated with your Oauth tokens.

Use directly:

```bash
npx openai-oauth

OpenAI-compatible endpoint ready at http://127.0.0.1:10531/v1
Use this as your OpenAI base URL. No API key is required.
Available Models: gpt-5.4, gpt-5.3-codex, ...
```

### `openai-oauth-provider`

This is a Vercel AI SDK Provider.

```ts
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { createOpenAIOAuth } from "openai-oauth-provider";

const openai = createOpenAIOAuth();

const result = await generateText({
	model: openai("gpt-5.4"),
	prompt: "write an essay about dogs",
});

console.log(result.text);
```

## Configuration

The CLI and the provider share the same core OAuth transport settings.

Reasoning precedence differs by request path: Chat Completions uses the request's `reasoning_effort` before the configured effort, while Responses normalization preserves an existing `reasoning` object without filling missing fields. See [CLI reasoning defaults](packages/openai-oauth/README.md#reasoning-defaults) and [provider reasoning defaults](packages/openai-oauth-provider/README.md#reasoning-defaults) for details.

## Features

What currently works:

- Working Endpoints:
  - `/v1/responses`
  - `/v1/chat/completions`
  - `/v1/models` (account-aware by default, or overridden with `--models`)
- Streaming Responses
- Toolcalls
- Reasoning Traces

## Known Limitations

What is intentionally not there yet:

- Only LLMs supported by Codex are available. This lists updates over time and is dependent on your Codex plan.
- Login flow is intentionally not bundled. Simply run `npx @openai/codex login` to create the auth file.
- There is no stateful replay support on the CLI `/v1/responses` endpoint. The proxy is stateless and expects callers to send the full conversation history.

## How it Works

OpenAI's Codex CLI uses a special endpoint at `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` to let you use special OpenAI rate limits tied to your ChatGPT account.

By using the same Oauth tokens as Codex, we can effectively use OpenAI's API through Oauth instead of buying API credits.

## Monorepo

- `packages/openai-oauth-core`
  Private shared transport, auth refresh, SSE helpers, and replay state.
- `packages/openai-oauth-provider`
  Public Vercel AI SDK provider that talks directly to Codex using local auth files.
- `packages/openai-oauth`
  Public CLI and localhost proxy package intended for `npx openai-oauth`.
